<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm <b>Jarvis aka Skelisol aka Dravynis. </b> I've also been called Jarvi or Jarvarvus, even Jarvina. LOL.
  I've mainly picked these names up in my younger years. Specifically when I lived in Pensacola Florida, right after high school. 
  You can say they're reserved for my closest friends.  Skelisol is the name I've been using for my internet persona. 
  Mainly, gamer tags, Zoom, Google, and social media accounts. Eventually, I'll link my personal business accounts as well. 
  Dravynis has been my cosplayer persona for a few years now. I'm currently in the 501st, Rebel Legion and The Dark Empire. 
  If you're not familiar, these are all Star Wars costuming groups. I love my time as cosplayer and helping other smile and have a good time.
</p>

<p>Currently, I'm in Dallas Texas. Lived here about 13 years now and its where I met my wife of 6 years this year, Kristina. I have a son that just turned
   23 this year. How I ended up in Dallas is its own story, but I've been working in IT since I've moved here. I've always had a thing for computers. 
   Nothing too complicated, just pretty familiar. It was a tool to explore and try to understand. I started off doing IT Suppport and the past 3
    years, I've been an Encompass Developer, which an application for managing mortgages.

<p>About 5 years ago, I finally settled on pursuing a career in Development. Started school at Western Governors University and graduated officially 
  January 2023 with a Bachelors in Science in Software Development. It... has been... a journey...  and it's led me to this. I want to become a Web Developer, 
  but not just any web developer. Virtual World Web Developer. What is that? Well you'll have to find out!!  
</p>
<p>This is the start of my journey in building my brand, <b>Vision Ascent!</b></p>
